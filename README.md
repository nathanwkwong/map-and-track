# map-and-track
This is a full-stack project which allows users to share their location on Google map with others. The stack involved in this project includes: Typescript, Vuejs, Nestjs, websocket, Jwt authentication, Mongodb and AWS services. Although the project idea is not new, I found that it is still fun and it allows me to try out new tech and frameworks.
