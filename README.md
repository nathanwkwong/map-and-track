# map-and-track
This is a full-stack project which allows users to share their location on Google map with others. The stacks invloves in this project includes Typescript, Vuejs, Nestjs, websocket, Jwt authentication, Mongodb and AWS services. Although the idea is no new, I found that it is fun and I would like to try out some new tech/frameworks. So I started to implement it out.
